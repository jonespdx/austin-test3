I'm a senior at [Arizona State University](asu.edu) in the [Sidney Poitier New American Film School](https://film.asu.edu/). I'm majoring in Film and Media Production, with an emphasis on Editing. I'll graduate in May 2025. My dream is to work in sports, music, or gaming videography or to create documentaries. While I have focused on editing at ASU, I also have interests in videography and cinematography, and I've taken all of the classes offered in Cinematography. 

I'm fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro and have used it to edit most of my projects. I've done coloring in Davinci Resolve and have experience in Sony Vegas. I use After Effects to create motion graphics and other animated projects. I am comfortable with basic camera and lighting equipment. I have experience with Google and Microsoft Office applications for word processing and presentations.

I enjoy sports: I played club baseball and high school baseball through my freshman year. I played club soccer and high school varsity soccer with my twin brother. I'm from Portland, Oregon, and I like to get outside to ski, mountain bike, and hike. I've played intramural volleyball at ASU.

I have a good understanding of social media, understand Spanish (but my speaking is rusty), and I have an enthusiastic and friendly personality.
